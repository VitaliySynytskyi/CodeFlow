# Welcome to [CodeFlow](https://codeflow.azurewebsites.net)

üëã Hi there! CodeFlow is a web application that allows developers to post and answer programming-related questions. It is similar to StackOverflow and was developed using Flask, with a MySQL database and SQLAlchemy as the ORM. The application also makes use of Azure services and the flasgger library for Swagger UI documentation.

# üöÄ Getting Started
To get started with CodeFlow, you'll need to have Python 3 and Flask installed on your machine. Follow the instructions on the official Python and Flask websites to install these dependencies.

Once you have these dependencies installed, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/VitaliySynytskyi/CodeFlow.git
```

Then, navigate to the project directory and install the remaining dependencies using the following command:

```
cd CodeFlow 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To start the application, simply run:

```
python app.py deploy
python app.py run
```


This will start the development server on http://localhost:5000.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack


- Backend: Flask - is a web development framework that allows for easy creation of web applications with Python. Flask-WTF is a Flask extension for working with web forms.
- Frontend: HTML/CSS, Bootstrap - are used for creating the user interface and styling the web pages.
- Database: MySQL - is a relational database management system used for storing and retrieving data.
- ORM: SQLAlchemy - is an Object-Relational Mapping library that provides a way to interact with databases using Python objects.
- Public API - thecatapi and cat-fact
- Azure services - Azure Text Analytics
- Unit testing framework: Pytest - is a testing framework for Python that allows for easy creation of tests and test suites.
- Dependency injection: Constructor injection (builtin) - is a design pattern that allows for the injection of dependencies into objects at runtime. In this case, constructor injection is built into the project.
- Swagger UI: flasgger - is a tool used for generating interactive API documentation from Swagger-compliant API descriptions.
- Deployment to Azure: Azure Web App service - is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering from Microsoft Azure that allows for deployment and scaling of web applications.
